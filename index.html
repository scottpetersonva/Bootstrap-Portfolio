                    <p>Hello! My name is Scott Peterson - as the header above indicates.  I enrolled in the University of Richmond Bootcamp because I wanted to an in-demand skill to make me a more marketable job candidate.  I'm enjoying the work so far; it combines the right balance of structure, creativity and problem solving.</p>

          <p>I grew up in the Northern Virginia suburbs and attended Falls Church High School where I competed in a number of varsity sports including Lacrosse, Golf, Track, Cross Country, and Wrestling.  After high school, I attended Longwood University, declaring as a Psychology major.  After completing Psychology 101, I decided that this major was not the right fit for me.  I spent my next semester taking a variety of gen ed courses.  After this semester I declared as a History major, stuck with it, and graduated with a B.A. in 2008.</p>

          <p>After college, I served for two years in the AmeriCorps VISTA program, where I was placed in the Environmental Protection and Natural Resources department of the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community.  I managed a volunteer engagement program and a blight removal program.  After my second term ended, I took a marketing position for a small engineering services company in Phoenix, AZ.  I organized events and made updates to the website.  This was my first real experience using HTML</p>

          <p>In the Summer of 2015 I moved back to Virginia, settling in Richmond to be closer to family.  I took a job with a healthcare services company - a temporary job which lasted for two years.  I was frustrated with almost ever aspect of the work and the organization.  This experience was one of the compelling events to learn a new skill.  As of now, I am focusing on the coursework in this bootcamp.</p>
